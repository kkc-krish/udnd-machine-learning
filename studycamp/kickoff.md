## Intro to Machine Learning 
*Notes from the talk by Josh Gordon 


* "Learning Python" recommended as a book for new Python coders.
* 99% of ML is about differentiation (classification). Instead of solving specific cases, ML focuses on learning to find and detect patterns (e.g., detect apples vs. oranges)
* It all starts with a "dataset" that provides examples of data.

Basic steps for ML 
* What is a Classifier
* How does it work
* How do I set it up

Tensor Flow For Poets
 * Trains state of the art classifier to detect art
 * Creates a TF model, that I can install on Android
 * Now point at a picture and it detects the image in real time
 * TF is open source (free) 

Deep Learning
 * Bit of a buzzword. Just a certain type of classifier. Solving problems in image recognition and speech recognition.
 * Recommends: "Programming Collective Intelligence" as a good book to start
 *
