# Sep Kickoff

## Study Camp Planning
You can find [the slides](http://bit.ly/mlcamp-2016-kickoff) here

## Intro to Machine Learning 
*Notes from the talk by Josh Gordon 


* "Learning Python" recommended as a book for new Python coders.
* 99% of ML is about differentiation (classification). Instead of solving specific cases, ML focuses on learning to find and detect patterns (e.g., detect apples vs. oranges)
* It all starts with a "dataset" that provides examples of data.

Basic steps for ML 
* What is a Classifier
* How does it work
* How do I set it up

Tensor Flow For Poets
 * Trains state of the art classifier to detect art
 * Creates a TF model, that I can install on Android
 * Now point at a picture and it detects the image in real time
 * TF is open source (free) 

Deep Learning
 * Bit of a buzzword. Just a certain type of classifier. Solving problems in image recognition and speech recognition.
 * Recommends: "Programming Collective Intelligence" as a good book to start
 * Find two people who teach the same concept in order to understand the basics
 * Stanford's advanced class: [cs231n.github.io](http://cs231n.github.io)
 * Google Deep Learning On Udacity
 * Tutorials at tensorflow.org
 * Tutorials at scikit-learn.org
 
Questions
 * When you train a classifier should you understand what it is doing under the hood? *The underlying ideas for basic classifiers are worth knowing. But for more advanced concepts, it is harder to understand (more research driven) so pace yourself.*
 * *Explain Tensor Flow For Mobile* Train ML model to recognize images on a laptop. Once trained, you can install the model anywhere (Android, Raspberry Pi) -- it is a bit of a hack. There are samples available.
 
 
 ## Python Primer
 Paul Logston 
 
  * Get the REPL running by typing "Python"
  * Write Functions: keyword "def" 
  * Indentation denotes code blocks (no braces)


  * For loops: 
    * JavaScript ```for (int i=0; i>len; i++)``` 
    * Python ```for _ in range(mykwarg): ```
 
 
  * Built in Data Structures
    * Dictionaries: ``` d = {'name': 'Paul', 'home': 'Harlem') ```
    * Set: ``` s = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ``` 
    * List: ``` l = [] ```
    * Extend List: ``` l.append(1) ```
