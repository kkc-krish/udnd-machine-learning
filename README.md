# Machine Learning Nanodegree

This GitBook is being used to maintain study notes and resources related to the [Udacity "Machine Learning" Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree-by-google--nd009) which is the precursor to the upcoming [Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). In that context, the chapters/content covered here may not be strictly reflective of the syllabus for the MLND. Rather, it serves as an unofficial guide for me to capture and share my notes or insights into the course.


## Background 
This section will capture notes/resources that are useful for getting up to speed with the requirements for any machine learning course. A good reference is the [list of Udacity courses on Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/courses/data-science). 

In particular:

* (cs101) [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) **(3 mos)** -- covers learning Python, the core programming language used
* (st101) [Intro to Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101) **(2 mo)** -- teaches basics of analyzing and visualizing data 
* (ud827) [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827) **(2 mos)** -- provides basic coverage of statistics to extract info from data 
* (ud170) [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170) **(6 wks)** -- covers key Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib etc.) for data analysis
* (ud201) [Intro to Inferential Statistics ](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201)**(2 mos)** builds on the Descriptive Statistics to teach prediction.


## Machine Learning ND
This section will capture notes/resources relevant to the following courses, that form the core of the [Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree-by-google--nd009). 

The Nanodegree currently identifies the following as *support courses*.

* (ud827) [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/courses/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827) (**2 mos**)
* (ud359) [Intro to Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/courses/intro-to-data-science--ud359) (**2 mos**)
* (ud600) [Reinforcement Learning ](https://www.udacity.com/courses/reinforcement-learning--ud600)(**4 mos**)
* (ud730) [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/courses/deep-learning--ud730) (**3 mos**)
* (cs373) [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://www.udacity.com/courses/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373) (**2 mos**)
* (ud501) [Machine Learning for Trading](https://www.udacity.com/courses/machine-learning-for-trading--ud501) (**4 mos**)

The Nanodegree currently identifies the following as *projects* to be done for certification.
* **P0: Titanic Survival Exploration** -- "create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster..."
* **P1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices** -- "build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then used to estimate the best selling price for your client’s home"
* **P2: Build a Student Intervention System** -- "your goal is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam."
* **P3: Creating Customer Segments** -- "Your task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories."
* **P4: Train a Smartcab to Drive** -- "you will use reinforcement learning to train a smartcab how to drive."
* **P5: Capstone Project** -- "..leverage what you’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques.."



## Self-Driving Car ND
This section will capture notes/resources relevant to the upcoming [Self-Driving Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013), some of which are speculative (since the official syllabus is not present).
