# Machine Learning Nanodegree

This GitBook is being used to maintain study notes and resources related to the [Udacity "Machine Learning" Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree-by-google--nd009) which is the precursor to the upcoming [Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). In that context, the chapters/content covered here may not be strictly reflective of the syllabus for the MLND. Rather, it serves as an unofficial guide for me to capture and share my notes or insights into the course.


## Background 
This section will capture notes/resources that are useful for getting up to speed with the requirements for any machine learning course. A good reference is the [list of Udacity courses on Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/courses/data-science). 

In particular:

* [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) **(3 mos)** -- covers learning Python, the core programming language used
* [Intro to Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-statistics--st101) **(2 mo)** -- teaches basics of analyzing and visualizing data 
* [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827) **(2 mos)** -- provides basic coverage of statistics to extract info from data 
* [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170) **(6 wks)** -- covers key Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib etc.) for data analysis
* [Intro to Inferential Statistics ](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201)**(2 mos)** builds on the Descriptive Statistics to teach prediction.


## Machine Learning ND
This section will capture notes/resources relevant to the following courses, that form the core of the [Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree-by-google--nd009). The Nanodegree currently identifies the following as *support courses*.

* [Intro to Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/courses/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827) (**2 mos**)
* [Intro to Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/courses/intro-to-data-science--ud359) (**2 mos**)


## Self-Driving Car ND
This section will capture notes/resources relevant to the upcoming Self-Driving Nanodegree, some of which are speculative (since the official syllabus is not present)
