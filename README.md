# Machine Learning Nanodegree

This GitBook is being used to maintain study notes and resources related to the [Udacity "Machine Learning" Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree-by-google--nd009) which is the precursor to the upcoming [Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). In that context, the chapters/content covered here may not be strictly reflective of the syllabus for the MLND. Rather, it serves as an unofficial guide for me to capture and share my notes or insights into the course.


## Background 
This section will capture notes/resources that are useful for getting up to speed with the requirements for any machine learning course.

## Machine Learning ND
This section will capture notes/resources relevant to the following courses, that form the core of the Machine Learning Nanodegree.

## Self-Driving Car ND
This section will capture notes/resources relevant to the upcoming Self-Driving Nanodegree, some of which are speculative (since the official syllabus is not present)
